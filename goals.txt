if a is in the big half push | but if its not the biggest one

//so i theoretically got the numbers i want to push
now i have sort a;

\
** push all the b first and then the small big("sb") ones if meta a bigger then next a swap
so
[2 ,3 13 ,11 , 5 ,34]
[s ,s, b, sb,  s,  b]
becomes 
rra rra rra pa  
[5 34 2 3 13]			[11]
[s  b  s s b]

|  rra pa |

[5 34 2 3]			[13 11]
|ra pa 
[2 3 5]			[34 13 11 ]
pb ra pb ra pb ra

***** malon mlkia gt prepei na stilw ta mikra kalitera bruhhhh should be faster

hmm also i should start shorting a while pushing to b using rrr would be good but i need checks

an ine megalitera apo to 3rd big tote push 


2				kk //smallese		index if you rra  count is 2
3				k
5				k
316				n	//bisggest
43				n
6				k
56				n 

hmm maybe now i can try the agc rule 
and do strlen for when do i use ra or rra cause if
position = len / 2 + 1 > to number else rra havent thought it through
so think again 
so do i first do the 10s the 100s or the 1000s

biggest or smallest first decide

hmm ok sort argv[0] first and then the rest
maybe i choose what gets you next to ther closest next number px
for this 
you can ra and then sa since its the small and second smallest

OK SO indexplacement IS A LIST WITH INDEX OF WHERE EVERYTHING SHOULD GO


3				i 1
5				i 2
21322			i 7 (last) 
316				i 6  
43				i 5   (2nd last)
6				i 3
56	            i 4

i think we haave a problem with hmm placement of indexplacement
and i think the list is not updated and has big ones too
the problemis that its nogetting updated althought its copy pasted
